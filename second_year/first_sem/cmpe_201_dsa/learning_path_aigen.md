## 📚 **Prerequisites Before Starting DSA in Python**

You should be comfortable with:

* ✅ **Basic Python programming**:

  * Variables, loops, conditionals
  * Functions and recursion
  * Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
  * Basic object-oriented programming (classes)

* ✅ **Problem-solving mindset**:

  * Breaking problems into steps
  * Understanding basic algorithm logic (like loops and conditions)

If you're new to Python, spend 1–2 weeks using:

* **CS50P** by Harvard: [cs50.harvard.edu/python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/)
* Or quick tutorials like [W3Schools Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
